# Asset Growth Anomaly Replication & Extension

This repository replicates and extends the asset growth anomaly first documented by **Cooper, Gulen, and Schill (2008)** in *“Asset Growth and the Cross-Section of Stock Returns”*.  
We examine whether firms with high asset growth earn lower subsequent stock returns than firms with low asset growth, and we test a modification of the original strategy design.

## Project Overview
- **Replication period**: 1962–2024 (out-of-sample evidence beyond the original 1968–2003 study).
- **Core finding**: Firms with low asset growth (Decile 1) significantly outperform high asset growth firms (Decile 10).
- **Traditional strategy**: Long Decile 1 / Short Decile 10 → delivers ~1.06% monthly alpha, 15% annualized.
- **Modified strategy**: Long Decile 1 / Short Decile 5 → delivers higher alpha (~1.79% monthly), lower drawdowns, and better Sharpe ratio.

## ⚙Methodology
- **Data sources**: Compustat Fundamentals Annual, CRSP Monthly, CRSP–Compustat Link Table.
- **Portfolio construction**:
  - Rank firms into deciles each June by asset growth.
  - Form value-weighted portfolios (held July–June).
  - Evaluate long–short strategies with and without modified shorting rule.
- **Performance evaluation**: Summary statistics, Fama–French 3-factor regressions, Fama–MacBeth cross-sectional regressions.

## Results Summary
- Asset growth anomaly persists through 2024, even post-publication.
- Traditional strategy remains profitable, but:
  - **Modified Long(1)/Short(5)** delivers superior risk-adjusted returns, with ~78% improvement in Sharpe ratio.
- Robust across bull/bear markets and after transaction cost adjustments.
